# Are you afraid of Deep Learning?

A Computational Linguistics/NLP reading group at the University of SÃ£o Paulo.

### [Spring/Summer Reading Schedule]

The group will be meeting nearly every Wednesday during the Spring/Summer of 2016/2017 on the NILC Lab from 9-11AM.

Everyone is welcome to participate (faculty and students alike). The only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time.
