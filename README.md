# Are you afraid of Deep Learning?

A Computational Linguistics/NLP reading group at the University of SÃ£o Paulo with focused on Deep Learning applied to NLP.

### [Spring/Summer Reading Schedule](https://github.com/edilsonacjr/DeepNILC/wiki/Spring-Summer-2016-2017-Reading-Schedule)

The group will be meeting nearly every Wednesday during the Spring/Summer of 2016/2017 on the NILC Lab from 9-11AM.

Everyone is welcome to participate (faculty and students alike). The only expectation is that participants read the paper scheduled for that week ahead of time and have some previous knowledge in machine learning and neural networks.
